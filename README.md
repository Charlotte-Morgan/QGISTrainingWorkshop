# QGIS Training Materials

I did a training course with the new content we are working on and I also thing the 
format works pretty well - though it is important to orientate people into how the 
training works since most people are used to 'follow the dots'. It also takes a 
little time to get used to the training modality but once they do I think they get 
much more in-depth knowledge.

Our plan is to build out a curriculum of vertical topics 
(e.g. symbology), horizontal topics (how do I combine skills from various vertical 
topics in a workflow), DRR specific training (generally theory of preparing for 
disasters) and InaSAFE (as a vertical topic). We also want to introduce the 
serious concept game into the curriculum.
